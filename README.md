# Python Bootstraps

Welcome to the Python Bootstraps repository! This collection provides tools and templates to streamline your Python project setup and environment management.

## Repository Structure

- **envs/**: Contains scripts and documentation to assist with creating and managing Python virtual environments.
- **projects/**: Includes starter templates for various Python projects to help you get up and running quickly.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/r-/Python-Bootstraps.git
   ```

2. **Setting Up Virtual Environments**:

   Navigate to the `envs` directory to find tools for managing virtual environments.

   ```bash
   cd Python-Bootstraps/envs
   ```

   - **create_env.py**: A script to automate the creation of virtual environments.
   - **activate_env.py**: A script to simplify the activation of virtual environments.
   - **README_virtual_envs.md**: Detailed instructions on using these scripts and general best practices for virtual environments.

   To create a new virtual environment using `create_env.py`:

   ```bash
   python create_env.py
   ```

   To activate an existing virtual environment using `activate_env.py`:

   ```bash
   python activate_env.py
   ```

   For more detailed information, refer to the [README_virtual_envs.md](https://github.com/r-/Python-Bootstraps/blob/main/envs/README_virtual_envs.md).

3. **Exploring Project Templates**:

   Navigate to the `projects` directory to explore available project templates.

   ```bash
   cd ../projects
   ```

   One of the available templates is `api_python_project_bootstrap.py`, which serves as a starting point for building Python APIs.

   To use this template:

   - Copy the `api_python_project_bootstrap.py` file to your project directory.
   - Rename it appropriately to reflect your project's purpose.
   - Modify the code as needed to suit your project's requirements.

   Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, which you can manage using the virtual environment tools provided in the `envs` directory.
